# CisTrans_NN

The purpose of this LSTM is to attempt to categorize Histidine kinase protein sequences as "cis" or trans".

It is a small project that was intended as part of my PhD thesis.

I post it here in the hopes that it's useful for somebody, but do not intend to mantain it. It worked quite well, although suffered of a
lack of training.

If you're going to copy it, Godspeed.
